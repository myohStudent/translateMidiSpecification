On Sunday, January 19, 2020 at the Annual Meeting of the MIDI Manufacturers Association, the complete suite of MIDI 2.0 specifications were adopted unanimously by the MMA members in attendance. 

These five core documents serve as the basis for the future expansion of MIDI. 

The following specifications are now available and included in a single Zip file in the link above.

## Introduction to MIDI 2.0
Back in 1983, musical instrument companies that competed fiercely against one another nonetheless banded together to create a visionary specification-MIDI 1.0, the first universal Musical Instrument Digital Interface.
Nearly four decades on, it's clear that MIDI was crafted so well that it has remained viable and relevant. Its ability to join computers, music, and the arts has become an essential part of live performance, recording, smartphones, and even stage lighting.
Now, MIDI 2.0 takes the specification even further, while retaining backward compatibility with the MIDI 1.0 gear and software already in use.
Here's why MIDI 2.0 is the biggest advance in music technology in decades.

MIDI 2.0 Means Two-way MIDI Conversations

MIDI 1.0 messages went in one direction: from a transmitter to a receiver.
MIDI 2.0 is bi-directional and changes MIDI from a monologue to a dialog.
For example, with the new MIDI-CI (Capability Inquiry) messages, MIDI 2.0 devices can talk to each other, and auto-configure themselves to work together.
They can also exchange information on functionality, which is key to backward compatibility-MIDI 2.0 gear can find out if a device doesn't support MIDI 2.0, and then simply communicate using MIDI 1.0.

Higher Resolution, More Controllers and Better Timing

To deliver an unprecedented level of nuanced musical and artistic expressiveness, MIDI 2.0 re-imagines the role of performance controllers, the aspect of MIDI that translates human performance gestures to data computers can understand. 
Controllers are now easier to use, and there are more of them: over 32,000 controllers, including controls for individual notes. Enhanced, 32-bit resolution gives controls a smooth, continuous, "analog" feel.
New Note-On options were added for articulation control and precise note pitch.
In addition, dynamic response (velocity) has been upgraded.
What's more, major timing improvements in MIDI 2.0 can apply to MIDI 1.0 devices-in fact, some MIDI 1.0 gear can even "retrofit" certain MIDI 2.0 features.

Profile Configuration

MIDI gear can now have Profiles that can dynamically configure a device for a particular use case.
If a control surface queries a device with a "mixer" Profile, then the controls will map to faders, panpots, and other mixer parameters.
But with a "drawbar organ" Profile, that same control surface can map its controls automatically to virtual drawbars and other keyboard parameters-or map to dimmers if the profile is a lighting controller.
This saves setup time, improves workflow, and eliminates tedious manual programming.

Property Exchange

While Profiles set up an entire device, Property Exchange messages provide specific, detailed information sharing.
These messages can discover, retrieve, and set many properties like preset names, individual parameter settings, and unique functionalities-basically, everything a MIDI 2.0 device needs to know about another MIDI 2.0 device.
